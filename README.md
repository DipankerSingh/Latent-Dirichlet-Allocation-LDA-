# Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-LDA-

Latent Topic Modelling, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation(It's a Probabilistic Generative Model). The Bayesian Inference was performed using Collapsed Gibbs Sampling . In this we find out the topic proportions for each document and word proportions for each topic using LDA. I have implemented the code in MATLAB for finding out the topic-proportions for each document and word-proportion for each topic.
