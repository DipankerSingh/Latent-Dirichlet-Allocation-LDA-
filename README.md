# Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-LDA-(code in MATLAB) 
 natural language processing algorithm 
 a probabilistic generative model
 for the classification of documents based on topic proportions and word proportions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
 the Bayesian Inference used Collapsed Gibbs sampling
 faster convergence than a conventional Gibbs sampler and low error ratio
